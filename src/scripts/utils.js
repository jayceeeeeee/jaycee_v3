 * then for the pixels it is also free in some way but
 *  still depends indirectly on the screen size of the user / materials used on Earth as electronics.
 *  so there is a kind of "objective" measure, but it is still a choice to use it or not, and how to use it.
 *      in reality it is becoming UI art, just like drawing, editing, modeling 3D, everything about technology is a Magical art = IT IS KUJUTSU!
 *      the simple fact that we code it and see the result is making us integrate our space time magically inside already & through the covenant ark.
 *          yes there is indeed 1billion ways to do "ART" on computer because ART is MAGICAL ART not outside art! just needed to find our own way. is it code?
